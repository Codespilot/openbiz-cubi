== Build and Deploy ==
After the code and metadata are finished and unit tested, it is the time to build it and deploy to test or production environment.

Cubi provides a build tool that helps creating a tarball of Cubi based applications. [CubiBuild Cubi Build Tool] includes more details of how to use the tool as well as a sample of RPM builder spec.

As all Cubi source is available, one can use his/her favorite build tool to create deployment package.

Please keep in mind after the application source is copied to the target application directory, it is recommended to run post actions including:
 * clean the cache directories
 * load your application modules
 * give write permission to proper folders 

The following snippet is copied form the sample rpm builder spec
{{{
cd %{contentdir}/%{name}/cubi
rm -rf files/cache/*
php bin/tools/load_module.php module1
php bin/tools/load_module.php module2
chmod -R 777 log/ session/ files/
