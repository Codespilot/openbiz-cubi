= Introduction =

Cubi provides developers a set of classes to configure dashboard where end user can add/edit/delete and drag-n-drop pre-configured widgets.

= Use Dashboard =

= Configure Dashboard =

Dashboard is a special view with a dashboard template. Here we use myaccount/view/MyDashboard.xml to show how to configure a dashboard view.

{{{
<EasyView Name="MyDashboardView" Description="Account Dashboard" class="common.view.DashboardView" TemplateEngine="Smarty" TemplateFile="dashboard_view.tpl" Access="myaccount.access">
    <FormReferences>

    </FormReferences>
</EasyView>
}}}

A dashboard view needs to have
 * implementation class as "common.view.DashboardView" or its subclass
 * a template file that include system_dashboard_view.tpl.html. dashboard_view.tpl includes system_dashboard_view.tpl.html
