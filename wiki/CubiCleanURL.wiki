= Cubi Clean URL =

Cubi applications by default have clean url to access Views. With some configuration changes at web server, the url can be even shorter.

== Basic Cubi URL Format ==

In Openbiz baseapp, a typical url to access a view is like http://host/baseapp/bin/controller.php?view=a.b.viewname. We call it raw openbiz url.

Cubi will map cleaner urls to raw urls by adding an index.php and .htaccess under the root directory of cubi installation.

*View mapping syntax*

|| *Clean URL* || *Raw URL* ||
|| /cubi/index.php/module/xaa
Sample: 
/cubi/index.php/system/userList||/cubi/bin/controller.php?view=module.view.XView
Sample: 
/cubi/bin/controller.php?view=system.view.UserListView ||
