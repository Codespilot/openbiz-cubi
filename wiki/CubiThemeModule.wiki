= Cubi Theme Module =

Cubi manages its GUI elements with themes. It is recommended that user interface resources including image files, css files, template files and etc are put into /cubi/themes/your_theme/ folder.

Cubi default theme can be set in app_init.php.
{{{
/* define themes const */
define('USE_THEME', 1);
define('THEME_URL',APP_URL."/themes");
define('THEME_PATH',APP_HOME.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."themes");        
define('DEFAULT_THEME_NAME',"default");
}}}

A theme is chosen by the following sequence
 # From browser cookie which contains theme name
 # From url parameter with string like "theme_name"
 # From DEFAULT_THEME_NAME defined in app_init.php

Administrator can use Cubi theme management module to view all themes and create a new theme.

=== Add a new theme ===

Clicking “Add” button will take user to “New Theme” page. When a new theme is saved, a new theme folder will be generated under /cubi/themes/.
Alternatively, a new theme can be added by coping the default theme folder to the new theme folder and modifying theme.xml under the new theme folder.
