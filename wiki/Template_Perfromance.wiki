#Template Performance Comparison: Smarty vs. Zend_View

= Introduction =

I've recently finished up a few code changes to fully support Zend_View in OpenBiz.  One can choose between Smarty and Zend_View for template purposes.  While Smarty is the more established, I was drawn to Zend_View due to expected performance gains.  Is Zend_View in fact faster than Smarty?  And if so, by how much?  The results below are revealing.  In short, Zend_View improved performance by almost 40%!

For this test, I created a simple ListView based off the Cubi application and stripped out much of the normal HTML.  For example, I removed the footer, left menu, breadcrumb and other extra HTML.

SMARTY
I then rendered the page using SMARTY exclusively.  Using Zend Studio's Profile tool, I was able to get a render time for each page load.  I made sure to load the page several times in case files needed to be cached.

Four recorded renders as well as the average are as follows:
179.31
152.18
223.02Z
223.33
--------
194.475

Zend_View
I performed the same sequence of steps as 2nd time for Zend_View and gathered these results.
116.78
114.6
112.83
135.28
--------
119.8725

Given the sizable performance advantages, I plan to migrate much of the default Cubi templates to PHP based Zend_View for my next project.  Perhaps we can post a 2nd template, just like the first, except based on Zend_View instead of Smarty.
