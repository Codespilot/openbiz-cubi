= Template Performance Comparison: Smarty vs. Zend View =

= Introduction =

I've recently finished up a few code changes to fully support Zend's template system in OpenBiz.  One can choose between Smarty and Zend for template purposes.  While Smarty is the more established, I was drawn to Zend due to expected performance gains.  Is Zend in fact faster than Smarty?  And if so, by how much?  The results below are revealing.  In short, Zend's template system improved performance by almost 40% over Smarty!

For this test, I created a simple ListView based off the Cubi application and stripped out much of the normal HTML.  For example, I removed the footer, left menu, breadcrumb and other extra HTML.

I then rendered the page using SMARTY exclusively.  Using Zend Studio's Profile tool, I was able to get a render time for each page load.  I made sure to load the page several times in case files needed to be cached.

Four recorded renders as well as the average are as follows:
  #179.31
  #152.18
  #223.02Z
  #223.33

Average: 194.475

==Zend View==

I performed the same sequence of steps as 2nd time for Zend and gathered these results.
  #116.78
  #114.6
  #112.83
  #15.28
Average: 119.8725

Given the sizable performance advantages, I plan to migrate much of the default Cubi templates to PHP based Zend for my next project.  Perhaps we can post a 2nd template, just like the first, except based on Zend instead of Smarty.
