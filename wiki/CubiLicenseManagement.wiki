== How License Work in Cubi ==

Openbiz Cubi is an open source platform, it does not mean the applications on top of it need to be open source as well. A Cubi application can be open source with GPL license or closed source with commercial license.

In order commercialize your applications, you can compile your PHP source with software like
  * Zend Guard
  * ionCube Encoder
  * SourceGuardian 

After your source code gets encoded, it is safe to deploy your applications without releasing the source. It does not prevent others downloading and using it. A common solution is to use license to control the usage of the applications.

The most flexible way of managing who use your applications is to specify certain license files when you compile or encode your source code. Then release the encoded package with license files. License files can protect your scripts against unauthorised use by locking to specific machines. They can also time expire, which is ideal for releasing evaluation versions and enforcing annual renewal business model.
