This book uses Cubi Trac to demonstrate the best practice of build Cubi applications. So we need to understand the business requirements of the Trac application.

Trac is a ticketing system that can be used in various business environment. 
 * For product development, Trac can be the bug tracking system. 
 * For customer service, Trac can be used to track the customer requests.
