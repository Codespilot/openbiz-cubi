= Build Cubi Applications =

Cubi's build tool is to make it easy to build Cubi-based application. Cubi builder is actually a warp script on top of Phing (http://phing.info/trac/) which is an Ant-like project build system.

The following files are needed to prepare application build assets under cubi/build folder
 * app_name.xml. The application main build xml.
 * app_name.properties. The application build property file
 * app_name.license.txt. The license file of the application.

Command to build the app:
{{{
# cd cubi/build
# build app_name [target]
}}}
Example: build cubi application 
{{{
# build cubi tar
}}}

After running the build command, a “gz” file is generated under /cubi/build/dist/app_name/. The file name depends on the settings in build property file. The property file defines
 * build.summary.
 * build.version. The version of the build
 * build.release. The release of the build

The generated file name is app_name-version-release.gz. For example, build.version is 0.3 and build.release is 1. Then the generated file name will be app_name-0.3-1.gz.

For the syntax of build.xml file, please refer to http://phing.info/trac/ or http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html
